# Breath-Detector
Detect stoppage of breathing and raise an alarm using the STM32F429 microcontroller
We use the STM32F429 microcontroller and a simple temperature and humidity sensor to detect whether a person has stopped breathing b detecting the fall in humidity values continuously.
The project was undertaken as part of the Real Time Embedded Systems (ECE-GY 6483) course, in a 4-member team consisting of Dipit Vasdev, Angie Fathalla, and Mingkun Tian.
